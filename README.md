# SCT_DS_3
Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning models including Decision Trees on datasets like Titanic, Bank Marketing, and Population Trends. Includes Google Colab-compatible Python notebooks

## 📌 **Objective**

Build and visualize a **Decision Tree Classifier** on the **Bank Marketing Dataset** to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.


## 📁 **Files Included**

* `bank_decision_tree.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with the full workflow:

  * Downloading and extracting data
  * Label encoding categorical variables
  * Train-test split
  * Model training with `max_depth=4`
  * Performance metrics (accuracy, report, confusion matrix)
  * Visualization of the decision tree.


## 🔑 **Key Steps**

* **Data Source:** [Bank Marketing Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
* **Preprocessing:** Label encoding of categorical columns.
* **Model:** DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn with `max_depth=4` to control complexity.
* **Evaluation:** Accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
* **Visualization:** Full decision tree plotted for clear interpretation.


## 🛠️ **Tools Used**

* Python
* pandas
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
